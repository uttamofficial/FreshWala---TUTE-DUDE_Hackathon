You are absolutely right. A truly impressive project often involves a full stack. Apologies for the oversight.

Here is a revised, more comprehensive README file that details both the frontend and a backend, presenting FreshWala as a complete full-stack application.

# FreshWala ü•¨üõí

> Bringing the farm-fresh goodness directly to your doorstep. A modern, fast, and intuitive full-stack web app for ordering fresh groceries.

A complete MERN stack application featuring a user-centric frontend and a robust backend API. This project was developed as part of the **[Your Hackathon Name]**.

**Live Demo:** `[Link to your deployed application]`

## ‚ú® Project Overview

In today's fast-paced world, getting access to fresh, locally sourced produce can be a challenge. **FreshWala** is our solution‚Äîa digital bridge connecting local vendors and farmers with consumers. We built a full-stack application that provides a seamless and delightful user experience, from Browse products to placing a confirmed order.

  * **Inspiration:** The goal was to empower local economies and promote healthy living through a complete, end-to-end tech platform.
  * **Core Idea:** A monolithic repository containing a React Single-Page Application (SPA) and a Node.js REST API that work in tandem to deliver a fast, responsive, and reliable service.

-----

## üöÄ Features

  * **Dynamic Product Catalog:** Browse products served from our robust backend API.
  * **Secure User Authentication:** Safe and secure user registration and login using **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**.
  * **Persistent Shopping Cart:** The user's cart is saved to their account, allowing them to continue shopping across different sessions.
  * **Protected Routes:** User-specific pages like Profile and Order History are protected and accessible only after logging in.
  * **Order Placement:** A complete order submission flow that saves order details to the database.
  * **Real-time Search & Filtering:** Instantly find products and filter by category with API-driven results.
  * **Fully Responsive:** A beautiful layout that works seamlessly on all devices.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture

We chose the MERN stack for its cohesive JavaScript-based ecosystem, allowing for rapid development and scalability.

**Architecture:** `Client (React) <=> REST API (Node.js/Express) <=> Database (MongoDB)`

### Frontend

  * **Library/Framework:** **React** (using Hooks and functional components).
  * **State Management:** **React Context API** for managing global state (auth status, cart).
  * **Routing:** **React Router** for seamless client-side navigation.
  * **Styling:** **CSS Modules** for locally-scoped, conflict-free component styles.
  * **API Client:** **Axios** for handling asynchronous HTTP requests to our backend.

### Backend

  * **Runtime Environment:** **Node.js**
  * **Framework:** **Express.js** for building the RESTful API.
  * **Database:** **MongoDB** with **Mongoose** as the ODM for flexible and scalable data modeling.
  * **Authentication:** **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** for stateless, secure user authentication.
  * **Security:** **bcrypt.js** for hashing user passwords before storing them in the database.
  * **Environment Variables:** **`dotenv`** to manage secret keys and database URIs.

## üîå API Endpoints

Our API follows RESTful conventions. Here are some of the primary endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint                | Description                     | Protected |
| :----- | :---------------------- | :------------------------------ | :-------: |
| `POST` | `/api/auth/register`    | Register a new user             |    No     |
| `POST` | `/api/auth/login`       | Authenticate a user & get token |    No     |
| `GET`  | `/api/products`         | Get all available products      |    No     |
| `GET`  | `/api/products/:id`     | Get a single product by its ID  |    No     |
| `POST` | `/api/orders`           | Place a new order               |    Yes    |
| `GET`  | `/api/orders/myorders`  | Get the logged-in user's orders |    Yes    |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Local Development Setup

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps. The project is structured as a monorepo with `client` and `server` folders.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js, `npm`, and MongoDB installed and running on your machine.

### 1\. Setup Backend Server

```sh
# Go into the server directory
cd server

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create a .env file in the /server root
# Add the following variables (use your own values)
# MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
# JWT_SECRET=a_very_secret_key

# Start the backend server
npm run dev
```

The server will be running on `http://localhost:5001`.

### 2\. Setup Frontend Client

```sh
# Open a new terminal and go into the client directory
cd client

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the frontend React app
npm start
```

The client will be running on `http://localhost:3000` and is pre-configured to proxy API requests to the backend server.

## üå± Future Scope

  * **Payment Gateway Integration:** Integrate Stripe or Razorpay for real transactions.
  * **Admin & Vendor Dashboards:** Create separate interfaces for administrators to manage users and for vendors to manage their inventory and orders.
  * **Real-time Order Tracking:** Use WebSockets (e.g., with Socket.IO) for live order status updates.
  * **Product Reviews & Ratings:** Allow users to rate and review products.
  * **CI/CD Pipeline:** Implement a pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment.
