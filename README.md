## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture

We chose a modern, scalable, and efficient tech stack to bring this project to life.

  * **Frontend:** **React** (using Hooks and functional components for a declarative UI).
  * **State Management:** **React Context API** for managing global state like the shopping cart, ensuring a lightweight and efficient solution.
  * **Routing:** **React Router** for seamless client-side navigation between pages.
  * **Styling:** **CSS Modules** to create locally-scoped, conflict-free styles for our components.
  * **API Calls:** **Axios** for handling asynchronous HTTP requests to our backend/mock API.
  * **Icons:** **React Icons** for a comprehensive and consistent set of icons.

Our architecture is based on a **component-driven design**, where the UI is broken down into small, reusable, and independent components. This approach made our development process faster and the codebase easier to maintain.
